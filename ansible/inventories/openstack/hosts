[nexus:vars]
# This variable used to be declared in group_vars/nexus.yml, but we had to move it when we incorporated Packer into
# the project. The reason is that when Packer runs, it creates a temporary inventory file in the same directory as
# this file, so that it will get access to the variables in group_vars/. If 'ansible_ssh_private_key_file' is defined
# there, it'll override the temporary keypair that Packer created and passed to ansible-playbook with the
# '--private-key' option.
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/unidata_provisioner_id_rsa
