[nexus]
# Note: This is the value of the Terraform variable "${openstack_networking_floatingip_v2.nexus.address}".
# Unfortunately, I don't think there's a simple, automatic way to have its value written here and then persisted to Git.
# Maybe we could use a dynamic inventory script instead:
#    http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_dynamic_inventory.html#example-openstack-external-inventory-script
# I suppose that eventually we'll be able to put "artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu" here and handle any hostname-to-IP
# mapping updates in DNS or /etc/hosts.
149.165.157.61

[nexus:vars]
# This variable used to be declared in group_vars/nexus.yml, but we had to move it when we incorporated Packer into
# the project. The reason is that when Packer runs, it creates a temporary inventory file in the same directory as
# this file, so that it will get access to the variables in group_vars/. If 'ansible_ssh_private_key_file' is defined
# there, it'll override the temporary keypair that Packer created and passed to ansible-playbook with the
# '--private-key' option.
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/unidata_provisioner_id_rsa
