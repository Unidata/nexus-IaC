# Some Ansible features depend on Python packages that aren't installed with the default Python distribution.
# We must install those packages ourselves, and of course we use Ansible for the task. Unfortunately, the Ansible
# instance that INSTALLS the packages cannot then USE the packages; they can only be loaded by a brand new Python
# interpreter running a new Ansible instance. As a result, we've separated the Python package installation into its
# own playbook (this file). This playbook should be run before other playbooks that require the packages.
